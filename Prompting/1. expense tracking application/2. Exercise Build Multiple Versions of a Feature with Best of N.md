## Part 1: Understanding the Best-of-N Pattern

### What is Best-of-N?

The Best-of-N pattern leverages a unique advantage of AI labor: **it's fast, cheap, and egoless**. Unlike human developers, Claude doesn't get frustrated when you ask it to throw away work and try again.

**Traditional Development**:

- Implement one solution
- Stick with it (too expensive to rewrite)
- Hope it's the best approach
    

**AI Labor Development**:

- Implement 3-5 different solutions
- Compare and evaluate all of them
- Choose the best or combine elements
- Total time: Still faster than one traditional implementation

### Why This Works

1. **AI is fast**: What takes days for humans takes minutes for AI
2. **AI is cheap**: Even premium AI usage costs less than developer time
3. **AI is creative**: Each attempt can explore radically different approaches
4. **AI is egoless**: No hurt feelings when you discard its work

## Part 2: Setting Up for Multiple Implementations

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

First, make sure your expense tracker is committed and working:

```
cd expense-tracker-ai
git add .
git commit -m "Initial expense tracker implementation"
git status
```

### Step 2: Launch Claude Code

## Part 3: Implementing Version 1 - Simple CSV Export

### The Feature Request

We're going to implement data export functionality three different ways. Let's start with Version 1.

**Prompt for Version 1:**
```
I want to add data export functionality to my expense tracker. For this first version, implement a SIMPLE approach.

VERSION CONTROL:
- Before you start, create a new branch called "feature-data-export-v1"
- Make all your changes in this branch
- Commit your changes when complete

VERSION 1 REQUIREMENTS:
- Add an "Export Data" button to the main dashboard
- When clicked, export all expenses as a CSV file
- Include columns: Date, Category, Amount, Description
- Use a simple, straightforward implementation
- Keep the UI minimal - just a button that triggers the download

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
Focus on simplicity and getting it working quickly. Don't overthink the user experience - just make it functional. Use standard browser APIs for file download.

PROCESS:
1. Create and checkout the new branch "feature-data-export-v1"
2. Implement the CSV export functionality
3. Add the export button to the dashboard
4. Test that it works correctly
5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message

Remember: This is Version 1 of 3 - keep it simple and functional.
```

### What to Observe

As Claude works on Version 1, notice:

- How it creates the branch
- The approach it takes (likely using browser APIs)
- The simplicity of the implementation
- Where it places the export button
- How it formats the CSV data

### Test Version 1

Once Claude completes the implementation:

1. Start the development server: npm run dev
2. Add some test expenses
3. Click the Export button
4. Verify the CSV file downloads and opens correctly

## Part 4: Implementing Version 2 - Advanced Export with Options

### Reset and Create Version 2

Now we'll ask Claude to implement the same feature completely differently.

**Prompt for Version 2:**
```
Excellent work on Version 1! Now I want you to implement the SAME data export feature in a completely different way.

VERSION CONTROL:
- Switch back to the original branch (before any export functionality)
- Create a new branch called "feature-data-export-v2"
- This should be a completely fresh implementation

VERSION 2 REQUIREMENTS:
Implement an ADVANCED export system with these features:
- Export modal/dialog with multiple options
- Multiple export formats: CSV, JSON, and PDF
- Date range filtering for exports (start date, end date)
- Category filtering for exports (select specific categories)
- Preview of data before export (show table of what will be exported)
- Custom filename input field
- Export summary showing how many records will be exported
- Loading states during export process

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
This version should feel like a professional business application export feature. Think about what a power user would want - lots of control and options. Use a modal or drawer interface, not just a simple button.

Make this implementation completely different from Version 1:
- Different UI components and patterns
- Different user experience flow
- More sophisticated code architecture
- Professional polish and attention to detail

PROCESS:
1. Switch back to original branch
2. Create and checkout: git checkout -b feature-data-export-v2
3. Implement the advanced export system
4. Test all the functionality thoroughly
5. Commit your changes

Show me what's possible with a more sophisticated approach. Be creative!
```

## Part 5: Implementing Version 3 - Cloud Integration

### Create Version 3

Let's explore a third completely different approach.

**Prompt for Version 3:**
```
Great work on Version 2! Now let's try a third completely different approach to the same export feature.

VERSION CONTROL:
- Switch back to the original branch (clean state, no export features)
- Create branch "feature-data-export-v3"

VERSION 3 REQUIREMENTS:
Implement a CLOUD-INTEGRATED export system with these features:
- Email export functionality (simulated - show UI flow)
- Google Sheets integration mockup (show what the flow would look like)
- Automatic backup scheduling options (UI for setting up recurring exports)
- Export history tracking (show previous exports with timestamps)
- Sharing capabilities - generate shareable links or QR codes
- Export templates (different formats for different purposes: "Tax Report", "Monthly Summary", "Category Analysis")
- Integration mockups with popular tools (Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.)
- Cloud storage options and sync status indicators

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
Think like a modern SaaS application - focus on connectivity, sharing, and integration with other services. Even if we're simulating some integrations, make the UI and user flow feel like a real cloud service.

This should feel completely different from both Version 1 (simple) and Version 2 (advanced local):
- Modern cloud service aesthetic
- Focus on sharing and collaboration
- Integration-first mindset
- Background processing concepts
- Service connectivity themes

Be creative and surprise me with innovative features around data export, sharing, and cloud integration that I might not have thought of!

PROCESS:
1. Switch to the original branch
2. Create and checkout: git checkout -b feature-data-export-v3
3. Implement the cloud-integrated export system
4. Make it feel modern, connected, and innovative
5. Commit your changes

Think big picture - how would a company like Notion or Airtable approach this feature?
```

## Part 6: Comparing Your Three Versions

### Switch Between Branches

Now you can easily switch between all three implementations:
```
# View all branches

git branch -a
  

# Switch to Version 1

git checkout feature-data-export-v1
npm run dev

# Test the simple CSV export

  

# Switch to Version 2

git checkout feature-data-export-v2
npm run dev

# Test the advanced modal with options

  

# Switch to Version 3

git checkout feature-data-export-v3
npm run dev

# Test the cloud integration features
```
